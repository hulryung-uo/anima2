# CLAUDE.md — anima2

**Read [`docs/DESIGN.md`](docs/DESIGN.md) first.** It is the source of truth:
what anima2 is, the decision history (the *why*), architecture, the
Observation/Action contract, the learning plan, the roadmap, and what to reuse
from `anima` (v1). This project is designed to be resumable from that doc alone.

## What this is
A new, from-scratch **autonomous AI agent** that plays Ultima Online — the
**Brain**. It drives a body, [`anima-core`](../anima-client/crates/anima-core)
(Rust headless UO client), through a structured **Observation/Action contract**.
Clean redesign of `../anima` (v1, Python); mines v1 for assets and lessons.

## Current phase
**Phase 1 in progress.** Python package (`anima2/`) implements the two-rate brain
loop driving a persona against `MockBody` — `contract` (mirrors anima-core
`agent.rs`) · `body`+`MockBody` · `persona` · `skills` (`Wander`/`GoTo`) ·
`planner` · `reflexes` · `agent`. `python -m anima2` runs a demo; `pytest` = 7
green; ruff clean. **Next:** IPC bridge to `anima-net` (real body on live ServUO)
+ more skills, then the LLM cognition loop. See DESIGN.md §10.

## Dev
`uv venv && uv pip install -e ".[dev]"` · `python -m anima2` · `pytest -q` · `ruff check .`

## Non-negotiable principles (DESIGN.md §2)
- **Brain ⊥ Body.** anima2 reads Observations and emits Actions — it **never**
  parses packets or touches a socket. The body (anima-core) owns the wire.
- **Hierarchical, two-rate loop.** Fast loop (~100–250ms) is deterministic skills
  + reflexes + planner, **no LLM**. Slow loop (seconds–min, async) is LLM
  cognition that *steers* — it never sits in the hot path.
- **Priors + skill library + curriculum before gradient RL.** Sandbox UO has no
  reward gradient; LLM priors + the `../uowiki` "textbook" + a curriculum are the
  fast accelerant. RL/Foundry evolution optimize bottlenecks later.
- **Three planes kept separate:** Play (the contract) · Control (GM scenario
  control, reuse v1 Foundry kernel) · Director (curriculum). Control plane lives
  outside both brain and body.
- **Reuse v1's hard-won assets, rebuild its structure** (DESIGN.md §8).

## Likely stack (open — DESIGN.md §9)
Python brain talking to anima-core over the contract via IPC (reuse v1's
brain/Foundry/wiki/LLM assets). LLM provider abstracted, default to latest Claude
family, tiered (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus); **never in the fast loop**. Consult the
`claude-api` skill when wiring LLM calls.

## Key references
`../anima` (v1: personas, planner, Foundry kernel, wiki flywheel), `../uowiki`
(semantic memory + MCP tools), `../anima-client/docs/DESIGN.md` (the body + the
original contract sketch), `../servuo` (local test shard).
