"""Unified circuit-breaker / cooldown abstraction.

Near-verbatim port of v1's `../anima/anima/planner/circuit_breaker.py` (218
lines, zero anima-internal imports — the scout's own "just port this file"
verdict, PHASE4.md item 1). Generic over any `Hashable` target key; anima2's
first user is `wiki.py::Wiki._report_breaker`, keyed on `(page,
claim_fingerprint)` so a live reflection loop can't flood `reports/open/`
with duplicate filings of the same claim about the same page.

Usage:
    breaker = CircuitBreaker(max_failures=3, cooldown_s=600)
    if not breaker.is_open(target):
        result = attempt(target)
        if result.success:
            breaker.record_success(target)
        else:
            breaker.record_failure(target)
